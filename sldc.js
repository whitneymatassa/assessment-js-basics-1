// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain
// Rinse & Repeat

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the requirements for the goal to be executed are determined and detailed so to know which direction to take and resources to use in creating the product. This would include determining which methods and languages to use."
const design = "This is the third step, in which the structure and steps are outlined to provide a clear blueprint for how to proceed in the actual product creation."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the design is executed or coded using the methods and languages determined in the previous steps in alignment with the design created."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which the code or software is run to identify bugs and to fix or adjust anything to ensure that it meets the requirements of the goal. This is then integrated or added into the environment for which it was created for."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which the code, program or software is kept working properly and adapts as needed to continue to meet the goals over time."
